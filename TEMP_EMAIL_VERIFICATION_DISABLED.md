# TEMPORARY: Email Verification Disabled

This document outlines the temporary changes made to disable email verification in the application. These changes should be reverted when email verification functionality is ready to be re-enabled.

## Changes Made

1. **In `src/lib/authoptions.ts`**:
   - Commented out the email verification check in the credentials provider
   ```javascript
   // TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Email verification check
   // if (user.emailVerified === false && user.provider !== "google") {
   //   throw new Error("Please verify your email before logging in");
   // }
   ```

2. **In `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`**:
   - Modified the user creation to set `emailVerified: true` by default
   - Commented out the email sending functionality
   - Updated the success message to remove reference to email verification
   - Modified imports to avoid unused import warnings

## How to Re-Enable Email Verification

To re-enable email verification, follow these steps:

1. **In `src/lib/authoptions.ts`**:
   - Uncomment the email verification check:
   ```javascript
   // Check if email is verified for credential login
   if (user.emailVerified === false && user.provider !== "google") {
     throw new Error("Please verify your email before logging in");
   }
   ```

2. **In `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`**:
   - Change `emailVerified: true` back to `emailVerified: false`
   - Restore the original email sending code (remove comments)
   - Restore the original success message about checking email
   - Restore the original import for `sendVerificationEmail`

## Why This Was Done

Email verification was temporarily disabled to resolve deployment issues and ensure the application can function properly in production without relying on email services. This is a temporary measure and should be properly implemented when the application is ready for production use.
