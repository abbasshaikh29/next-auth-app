# Email Verification Enabled

This document confirms that email verification has been re-enabled in the application.

## Changes Made

1. **In `src/lib/authoptions.ts`**:
   - Uncommented the email verification check in the credentials provider
   ```javascript
   // Check if email is verified for credential login
   if (user.emailVerified === false && user.provider !== "google") {
     throw new Error("Please verify your email before logging in");
   }
   ```

2. **In `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`**:
   - Changed `emailVerified: true` back to `emailVerified: false`
   - Restored the original email sending code
   - Restored the original success message about checking email
   - Restored the original import for `sendVerificationEmail`

## Email Configuration Options

For email verification to work, you need to configure an email service. You have several options:

### Development Mode

1. **Auto-Verify Emails (Recommended for Development)**
   - Add `AUTO_VERIFY_EMAIL=true` to your `.env.local` file
   - This will automatically verify user emails during registration in development mode

2. **Use the Manual Verification Tool**
   - A manual verification tool is available at `/dev/verify` in development mode
   - This allows you to manually verify a user's email without sending actual emails

3. **Use Ethereal Email (Test Service)**
   - Create a test account at https://ethereal.email/
   - Configure the email settings in your `.env.local` file

4. **Use a Real Email Service**
   - Configure a real email service like Gmail, SendGrid, etc.
   - For Gmail, you'll need to create an App Password

### Production Mode

In production, you should configure a real email service:

```
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=your-smtp-host
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=your-smtp-port
EMAIL_SERVER_SECURE=true-or-false
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email-username
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-email-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-from-email
```
